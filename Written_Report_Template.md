# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This Project is helping Louis, customer, to raise fund for her play. Give an insight of how much budget she needs for success to make a show for her play.
### Purpose
Purpose of this Project is to help customer who want to see the analysis on plays that was sucessful on data. Seeing the goal budget for her fund by creating filter, pivot table, and charts from excel
## Analysis and Challenges
I performed challenges by instructions. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
On this, I stumbled on the rows value. I figured out to add Date of Created for the rows value of pivot table. Still didin't sure because the number look different. Then, I clear the extra on the outcomes. Also, sorted the outcome in descendence took time to do it. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I followed instructions. Watch the video about COUNTIFS(). It helped 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For COUNTIFS() function I have results return all 0. I found out I didn't add "s" for play. That's the problem I encountered and fixed it, and it ran well

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
First conclusion I draw about Outcomes based on Launch Date is May is the Month that gave the best successful outcomes for plays funding. Customer should consider rasing fund on May, or June that is close in number of successful outcome
Second conclusion is October is high on getting failed outcomes. Csutomer should avoid that month

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage of successful outcome on compaign goal is around 35000 and 44999. Louis will need at least 35000 dollar to succeed 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations on this data is currency that is not in the same currency, the date and time is Unix, need to convert. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create table of goal, outcome and deadline. Graphs of outcomes based on deadline. 
Also, we can create outcomes and avaerga donation. See successful outcomes with donation Louis hope to get
